# Synthetic-Data-Generation-for-Autonomous-Vehicle-Simulation
This project focuses on creating a synthetic data pipeline for autonomous vehicle simulation using CARLA simulator, GANs and computer vision techniques.
Objective: Building a pipeline to generate synthetic datasets for training and testing autonomous driving systems
Key Features:
1) Allows simulating realistic driving environments by integrating CARLA open-source simulator
2) Generates edge-case scenarios using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) generative model
3) Provides labeled data for tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation and lane detection
